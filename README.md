# EngineersGuide
======================== What is Engineers Guide? ========================>>

Engineers Guide is an application that helps the engineers to memorize stuff and back for them when they need very easly. Instead of wasting a lot of time, the user can collect all the data/details of specific component and insert it inside card view to return for it when he needs it. 

fothermore, this application will allow the user of inserting an image of that component, and having 3 resources as maximum.

====================== List of technologies used =======================>>

Android Studio,
mockAPi,
Firebase,
Figma,
Github,
Kotlin

======================= User Stroies =======================>>

- As Engineers Guide user I want to add an elements/items so that I can see the all the items/elments when I need.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to be able to delete elements/items if there are no longer needed so that user knows the elmenets he has.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to be able to edite elements/items so that the user can update his elements.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to be able to see the picture in it's actual size.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to to be able to see the email of who added a new components so I can contact with him later.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to be able to have a PDF copy of that element so I can share it in diffrent application or print it.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to be able to have login and password to protect my information so that I can have privacy.
- As Engineers Guide user I want to quick and easy access to the resources from the app it self.

====================== my development process ========================>>

In the beginning, I've started to think of how the app going to look like. For that reason, I began with sketching up my design by adding and removing features. Next, I've decided to make a brainstorm for getting new ideas from other people on social media, which was really helpful to me and opened my mind to new other ideas more than the requirements needed.

Then, as I finished sketching, I started my work with Figma till I got the last and simplest design. After that, started designing with Android studio where it was a much way harder than Figma, so I've spent some time working on the ideas and design, where the remaning time has been spent in coding.

Later on, during the coding process, I've faced a lot of difficulties such as adding swipe and swipe buttons so it appears after to the user when he swipes the element to the left, where it will show edit and delete button to the user to give easy access to these features from the the component fragment. In addition, dealing with logical errors either by gitting hints from my colleagues or help from the instructors.

====================== List unsolved problems ========================>>

- back button creates a bug with bottom action bar.
- getting the users profile page after pressing on the thier email inside details fragment


====================== Upcoming ========================>>

- messaging between two users.

- making groups.

- creating a fragment for added element by the user.

- giving the price and of the elemnt and showing if it's avilable or not in amazom or noon ..etc.

====================== functions work ========================>>
